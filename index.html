 <h2>MY STORY:</h2>
 <p>My first twitter growth course hit me hard.</p>
 
 <p>I realized the potential of making huge money no matter where you live and what you do</p>
 
 <p>But I got stuck... In phase 0.</p>
 
 <p>Making my profile looks perfect.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>I knew...</p>
 
 <p>That every day when my profile pic is crap and my banner is wasted space,</p>
 
 <p>I'm losing followers and money.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>I tried copying other big accounts</p>
 
 <p>But deep inside I knew:</p>
 
 <p>No matter what I do</p>
 
 <p>I'll be standing in the shadow of their success.</p>
 
 <p>I was lost in the sea of other generic accounts.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>I tried everything...</p>
 
<p> Putting keywords in my banner</p>
 
 <p>Making it visually pleasing and aesthetic</p>
 
 <p>Adding arrow pointing to a follow button...</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Nothing worked.</p>
 
 
 
<p> Then I took a deeper look at big accounts.
 
 And I realized what's the problem.</p>
 
 <p>It's not about numbers, no...
 
 Their storefront is perfect, regardless of the follower count.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Their pfp gets stuck in people's heads
 
 Their banner hits me with their big idea</p>
 
<p> Everything just makes sense</p>
 
<p> I realized...
 
 I can't get 10k followers if I don't look like a 10k profile.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>After that, I changed my profile pic.
 
 The profile clicks conversion increased by 7%.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>People started telling me they love my vibe</p>
 
 <p>People started noticing me in their timeline
 
<p> And last but not least... I became more relaxed.</p>
 
<p> For some weird reason, people's opinions stopped bothering me.</p>
 
 <p>I started to enjoy sharing whatever I want.</p>
 
<p> And you know what happens when you stop taking the game too seriously?</p>
 
 <p>You start to grow.</p>
 
 <p>I want to make it easy for you to make the perfect profile</p>
 
 <p>The profile that you'll see growing towards that desired 10k number</p>
 
<p> While you enjoy your life and make money on autopilot.</p>
